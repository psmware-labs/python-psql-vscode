Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go) and runtimes (such as .NET and Unity).

It also integrates seamlessly with Docker to allow for developing inside Docker containers. &quot;So what, Pat?&quot; I hear you say? Well, how about having your entire development environment and source all stored as code. This gives a consistent development environment for an entire team. All developers use the same OS for development, the same system libraries, and the same language runtime, no matter what host OS they are using.

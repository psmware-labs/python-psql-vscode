You can create a new repository on your personal account or in the organization from this template.  In this example, we are goin to create a new repository from the new template.  Whilst you can choose to make the repository either public or private, public repositories are visible to the public, while private repositories are only accessible to you, and people you share them with; I make any work related repositories private.

1. In the upper-right corner of any page, use the **+** drop-down menu, and select **New repository**.
